Simple fork of pacsdisplay to improve accessiblity of the tcl source (for study).

Code extracted from each *.exe can be found inside the *.vfs folder in the same directory. Things that looked like external libraries/packages have been removed from the *.vfs/lib/ directories (things such as tcl8, tk8, etc that get bundled into the *.exe that don't seem particularly interesting to study here)
